===================
Complexcity:
The above algorithm’s time complexity is exponential O(2^n), where ‘n’ represents the total number of items.
since for each element we have two choice(select and not to select) hence time complexity is exponential O(2^n).


The space complexity is O(n). This space will be used to store the recursion stack. Since our recursive algorithm works in a depth-first fashion, 
which means, we can’t have more than ‘n’ recursive calls on the call stack at any time.
