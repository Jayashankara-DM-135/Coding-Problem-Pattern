Algorithm

The algorithm is a standard binary search :

Initialise left and right indexes left = 0 and right = m x n - 1.

While left <= right :

Pick up the index in the middle of the virtual array as a pivot index : pivot_idx = (left + right) / 2.

The index corresponds to row = pivot_idx // n and col = pivot_idx % n in the initial matrix, and hence one could get the pivot_element. This element splits the virtual array in two parts.

Compare pivot_element and target to identify in which part one has to look for target.
